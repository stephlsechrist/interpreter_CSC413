# interpreter_CSC413

From the instructor's (Anthony Souza) assignment description:

>For this assignment you will be implementing the interpreter
program for the mock language X. You can think of the mock 
language X as a simplified version of Java. The interpreter is 
responsible for processing byte codes that are created from the 
source code files with the extension x. The interpreter and the 
Virtual Machine (this will be implemented by you as well) will 
work together to run a program written in the Language X. The 
two sample programs are a recursive version of computing the nth 
Fibonacci number and recursively finding the factorial of a 
number. These files have the extension x.cod.
